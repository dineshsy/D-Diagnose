  > D Diagnose helps you to identify if your plant is healthy or not.
  > It uses Decision Tree algorithm to predict the Health of the plant.
  
 ## Principle behind it
 
 The Decision Tree modal uses a huge dataset. The modal is trained with nearly 7000+ leaves datasets.
 
 To identify the health of a plant we use individual plant's leaf and its state of health as label.
 
 Based on the trained modal we can get the the accuracy upto 80%.
